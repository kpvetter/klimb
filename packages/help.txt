title: Welcome to KLIMB
alias: Overview
'''KLIMB''' is program which allows you to plan bike routes
interactively on topographical maps of the San Francisco Bay Area
and other areas.
Key intersections (nodes) and roads are marked on the map, and
you can get information, such as altitude, distance and climbing
about them.

You create routes by clicking on nodes marking key intersections
or on the links between the nodes (see [Creating Routes]).
As you are building the route,
the current distance, climbing and descending is displayed at
the bottom of the window.
At any time, with a press of the button,
you can get a distance and altitude profile of the route or a detailed
description of the current route.

Originally KLIMB was only available for the San Francisco Bay Area. But
now other areas such as central Ohio are available (see [Zones]).
Each zone is divided into several smaller, more managable areas
called [Regions]. For example, the Bay Area has regions like
the Peninsula, South Bay, East Bay and Marin.
-------------------
title: Quick Guide
Getting Started:
    * Scroll around the map using the middle mouse button or scroll bars
    * Create a route by:
       - clicking on the starting node
       - clicking on adjoining roads or nodes

Once you have a route, you can:
    * See its distance, climbing and descending statistics
    * [Print] it out
    * Create a [profile] graph
    * Create a written [route description]
    * Add [turn information] at each node
    * Animate a [trace] of the route
    * See all the [hills] on the route
    * Add [annotations]
-------------------
title: Road and Node Information
You can get information about a road or a node in several ways:
   * hover the mouse over a road
   * hover the mouse over a node
   * double click on a road or a node

The distance and climbing data comes from several sources.
For the Bay Area, almost all the
data comes from Bill Bushnell's Bay Area Atlas which he acquired by
riding each road.
For other zones some of the data is surveyed, but mostly it
is gathered statically:
node altitude comes from USGS topographical maps, road distance is
a spherical trigometric calculation based on the roads route
and climbing data is just an estimate
based on the altitude difference of a road's end points and any
intermediary waypoints. This
estimated data is marked with a "?" to indicate its less accurate nature.

People ask why do some roads follow the actual road but other roads
are straight lines. The answer is lack of time.
I call making a road follow its true course "bending" the road.
Bending is easy and kind of fun, but there are a lot of roads.
Volunteers "bent" many of
the roads already, more volunteers are welcome--let me know if you want
to help. Bending roads got a lot easier with the zoom feature.
-------------------
title: Scrolling the Map
You can move to a different part of the map by:
   * clacking and dragging the map with the mouse
   * use the scrollbars
   * use the mouse wheel (shift for horizontal scrolling)
   * drag the small box in the overview window

You can move to a particular node by:
   * double clicking on a node on the [Profile Graph]
   * double clicking on the node's name in the Node List window
-------------------
title: Data Quality

The distance and climbing data for the San Francicso Bay Area zone
comes from Bill Bushnell's Cycling Atlas which he gathered while
riding the roads with his Avocet 50 altimeter bike computer, often
riding the roads multiple times in both directions. In the Ohio zone,
I've surveyed about a third of the roads with my Avocet 50 computer.
The rest of the data are estimates--but often very accurately.

Node altitudes are estimated by using USGS elevation web service.

Road distances are estimated by computing the great circle distance
between the end points. If the road is "bent" to follow its true
course, then each small segment is summed producing a very accurate
estimate.

Climbing amounts are the hardest to get accurate. A basic estimate can
be achieved by just computing the difference in altitude of the end
nodes. While this will always be the less than or equal to the actual
amount climbing, in practice this is fairly good because most roads
have nodes at the bottom and top of their climbing sections.

To achieve a better estimate, for some roads the altitude of points on
the road are included in the climbing estimate. 

In summary, the quality of the climbing data comes in the following degrees
of accuracy:
  1) road surveyed
  2) road surveyed but only in one direction
  3) mid-road altitude waypoints
  4) end node altitude difference
  5) unknown

KLIMB will display roads with "bad" data in a distinct manner. What
qualifies as "bad" is configurable by the zone creator. You can see
this value in the [Options] dialog.
-------------------
title: Zones
alias: zone
Originally, KLIMB only covered SF Bay Area, but numerous people
asked about getting KLIMB to work for other areas. Then I moved
out of the Bay Area and I wanted KLIMB for my new location in
central Ohio.

To handle this, I introduced the concept of zones, which are just
a bunch of regions that share a common overview map and multi-region
selection map. You can change zones using the "Change Zone" command
on the File menu.

It is now well-defined and easy to create your own zones--email me
for details.

You can download more zones from the KLIMB web site at
http://www.klimb.org.
-------------------
title: Regions
alias: Region
KLIMB divides up the current zone into several regions. This is because
the loading all the maps at once would overwhelm the computer.

You can change regions using the "Change Region" command on the File menu.
You can also load multiple regions at once checking "Multiple Regions"
button on the Advanced Region Selection dialog. (NB. combining regions
may result in gaps in the map.)

You can download more regions from the KLIMB web site at
http://www.klimb.org.

'''Did you know?'''
   * You can set the region KLIMB starts in using the [Customize] feature.
-------------------
title: Routes
Routes are the roads and nodes that your bike ride will go on. As you
create a route, the current distance, climbing and descending is
displayed at the bottom of the window.

Once you've created the route, you can get information about it
in several different ways.
    * Profile: this shows you on a graph the climbing and descending on each leg
    * Description: this is a written description of the route.
    * Trace: this is an animation tracing out the route
    * [Hills]: this finds and highlight hills on your route

See also [Creating Routes] and [Saving and Loading Routes]
-------------------
title: Creating Routes
To create a route:
   * click on a node as the starting point
   * extend the route by
     1. clicking on an adjacent node
     1. or clicking on a connecting road
     1. or see [Extending Routes]

See [Creating New Nodes] and [Creating New Roads] to see
how you can create your own roads to add to your route.

Don't forget to save your work! (see [Saving and Loading Routes]).

'''Did you know?'''
 * You can use [Route Turnings] specify which direction to turn at each node. 

-------------------
title: Route Turnings
alias: turn information
Route turnings allow you to be more specific about how a route behaves
at a given intersection--turn right, left, go straight, u-turn, etc.
This information will appear on the route description.

By right clicking on a node in the current route and selecting
''Route Turnings'', you can specify if the route should turn left or
right, go straight, do a u-turn, etc.

If you don't specify a route turning, KLIMB will try and guess. It
uses the [arrow] information for its guess. This means if you turn off
arrows, you turn off KLIMB trying to guess route turnings.

If you select ''Omit from Route Description'', then that node will
be omitted and the two incoming roads will be joined into one. This
is helpful when your route traverses a long road which has numerous
intersecting roads.

'''Did you know?'''
    * Toggling [arrows] toggles KLIMB guessing route turnings
    * ''Omit from Route Description'' also omits it from the route profile.
    * ''Omit from Route Description'' also removes its [arrow].
-------------------
title: Saving and Loading Routes
Routes can be saved and loaded with the ''Save Route'' and ''Load Route''
commands on the File menu.

If the route contains any nodes and roads that you created yourself
(see [Creating New Nodes] and [Creating New Roads]), 
they will be saved and loaded
with the route.

Routes record which zone, region or multiple regions they were created in.
You cannot load a route for a zone which isn't the current one.
Also, you cannot load a route for a zone or region which you haven't downloaded.

See also [Favorites] and [Creating Routes].
-------------------
title: Creating New Nodes
To create a new node:
   1. right click where you want the node to be--not on a road
   1. select "Create New Node at Point"
   1. fill in the information you know

Don't forget to [save] your work!

'''Did you know?'''
 * You can use the [Zoom] feature to precisely position your new node.
 * You can use the [USGS Elevation] feature to determine its elevation.
 * You can use [Google] to see the location of the node.

------
title: Creating New Roads
To create a new road:
   1. right click anywhere not on a road or node
   1. select "Create New Road"
   1. fill in the information you know

See [Bending Roads] to make the road follow its true course.

Don't forget to [save] your work!

'''Did you know?'''
 * You can use the [Zoom] feature to [bend] your new road to match the \
actual road course.
 * You can use the [USGS Elevation] feature to determine the elevation for \
points along the road.
 * You can see the road on [Google].
-----
title: Splitting Roads

Sometimes you want your route to diverge partway along an existing road.
If so, you can ''split'' the road at that point creating a new node.

To split a road
   1. right click at the point on the road where you want the split
   1. select "Split Road at Point"
   1. fill in the information you know

'''Did you know?'''
 * You can use the [Zoom] feature to precisely position your new node.
 * You can use the [USGS Elevation] feature to determine its elevation.

------
title: Saving Your Work
alias: save

You can save the nodes, roads and splits you've created by selecting
"Save User Data" on the File menu. This will save the information
to a file called "user.nodes" in the current zone directory.
It will automatically get read whenever you run KLIMB and load that zone.

See also [Saving and Loading Routes].
-------------------
title: Printing Maps
alias: print

For Windows users, KLIMB can print maps, profiles, zoomed maps
and route descriptions. BUT I'm not letting you do it.

Actually I'll let you do it in return for you doing something to
improve KLIMB, such as filling in some missing data or bending
roads to match their actual course. For details see the
printing page on KLIMB's website (http://www.klimb.org/printing.html).

If you need to print something larger than the current screen check 
out the [Route Atlas] feature and the [Snapshot] feature

For Unix users, you have to use the [Route Atlas] or [Snapshot] feature.
-------------------
title: Ride Log
The Ride Log feature lets you keep a journal of all your rides.
It will keep track of the route, the date, distance,
time and other data. You can later view all you rides in the log
in a table.

To add to the Ride Log:
   * select the Tools->Add to Ride Log menu entry
   * fill in the form
   * click the "Add to Log" button 

To view the Ride Log entries:
   * select the Tools->View Ride Log menu entry
   * double clicking an entry will display the route
   * [ride log filter] lets you restrict which rides are shown
   * [ride log statistics] shows you simple statistics about all your rides

'''Did you know?'''
   * clicking on a column header sorts by that column.
   * clicking twice on a column headers sorts in the reverse direction.
-------------------
title: Snapshot

The snapshot feature lets you create jpeg or png images
of the current screen or multiple adjacent screens. For
multiple screens it will scroll the window to the
correct location then take the snapshot. It then joins
all the snapshots into one big image file.

You can then use an external tool to view or print the snapshot.

This feature requires the Img package. The Windows installation
has it embedded but for other users you must download it by
hand.
-------------------
title: Route Description
The route description provides various forms of written descriptions
of your current route.

'''Formats'''
    - ''Normal'': default verbose format.
    - ''Running Totals'': same as normal but with cumulative statistics.
    - ''Tab Delimited'': suitable for import into a spreadsheet.
    - ''Space Delimited'': same as above but suitable for printing.
    - ''Minimal'': most compact format.
    - ''Google Earth'': suitable for import into Google Earth
    - ''GPS Exchange'': an XML format for downloading to a GPS device.

'''Did you know?'''
   * You can edit the text in the description window.
   * [Route Turnings] can make your route description more exact.
   * You can [customize] which columns appear in the route description.
-------------------
title: Hills Dialog
alias: hills
The Hills Dialog finds and highlights all the hills on your route.
You can specify how high or steep a hill must be to be highlighted.

The accuracy of this data depends on the quality of the data
for the roads in your route. If the roads have had [USGS elevation]
information added to their waypoints then the data can be quite accurate.

See also [Gradients].

'''Did you know?'''
    * You can highlight a particular hill by clicking on its entry in the list.
    * Hovering over a hill will display its height and slope.
    * Hills are also displayed on the [profile graph].
    * [GPS Tracks] has a similar feature.
----
title: Latest Version

Here are some additional features added since ''version 4.10''.

'''Favorites'''

[Favorites] provides quick and easy access to a list of
your favorite rides. 

'''Extend Route'''

[Extend] your route to any node via the shortest possible path.

___________________________________________________

Here are some additional features added since [version 4.0].

'''ROUTE ATLAS'''

[Route Atlas] are a way of getting better, more detailed maps
of your route.

'''ARROWS'''

[Arrows] option displays directional arrows at every intersection
along your route.

'''PDF'''

You can now get your [profile graph], your [route description] and
your [route atlas] saved in PDF file format.

'''GRADIENTS'''

You can calculate the gradient for any portion of a any road
using the [Gradient] feature.
-----
title: What's New in Version 4.0
alias: Version 4.0

'''NEW MAPS'''

The maps that KLIMB used originally for the San Francisco Bay Area had
one fatal flaw: their latitude and longitude coordinates were
inconsistent with both the USGS maps and with Google maps. So, if you
used the [zoom] feature and [bent] a road to match its course exactly,
it would be displayed on the master map incorrectly. Version 4.0 now
only uses maps from USGS. (This means, however, you must download
again all the regions you're interested in.)

'''ELEVATIONS INFO FROM USGS'''

The [USGS] offers a web service in which you can get the elevation for
any point in the US (and parts of Canada, I believe). So now you 
accurately determine the height of any node or waypoints along a road.

'''HILLS'''

The new elevation data from the USGS now enables you to see all
the individual [hills] along your route, and to find out how much
it climbs in how much distance.

'''GOOGLE EARTH'''

View your route on the globe with [Google Earth] or on a 
flat map with Google Maps.

'''ROUTE INFO'''

Want to know the biggest climb on your route, or how about
the highest point? The [Route Info] dialoge will show you
this. In addition, you can use it to add [annotations] to
your route.

'''PROFILE LABELS'''

The [Profile Graph] now has an option to display the node names.

'''PROFILE 3D APPEARANCE'''

The [Profile Graph] now has an optional sexier, 3D look to it.

'''MILEPOSTS'''

You can have [milepost] markers placed at intervals along your route.

'''ROUTE DESCRIPTION COLUMNS'''

You can now [configure] which columns appear in the [route description].

'''ESTIMATED TIMES'''

The [route description] will estimate at what time you'll arrive 
at a different point given an average speed.

'''WEATHER FORECAST'''

You can get a 5-day forecast for the [weather] in your region.

'''PICTURE GALLERY'''

The [Picture Gallery] is a fun collection of some cycling photos.


-------------------
title: What's New in Version 3.06
alias: Version 3.06

'''PRETTIER'''

KLIMB now uses a better looking widget set so everything should
look better, especially buttons and the toolbar.

'''BETTER DATA'''

The road data base has been greatly improved with many more
roads bent to follow their true course.

'''SNAPSHOT'''

You can capture the current screen or multiple adjacent screen
into one large image file.

'''GOOGLE'''

You can view roads and nodes on a map with [Google].

'''WHO NEEDS BENDING'''

If you become superuser, then a new command appears on the
view menu which will highlight all roads that still need
bending.
-------------------
title: What's New in Version 3.0
alias: Version 3.0

'''PRINTING'''

On Windows, you can now print out any maps, climbing profile,
route description or zoom map. Printing out a map that you've
added route annotions (see below) is really nice.

'''ZOOM'''

You can zoom in on any road, node, [poi], [geocache] or arbitrary
location. It automatically downloads maps from the USGS terraserver,
allowing you to zoom in to on any place on the map at up to
1 pixel = .25 meter resolution.

On the zoom map, you can bend roads or adjust the position
of a node. You can also print out a zoom map.

You must be connected to the internet to use this feature. KLIMB
should be able to determine your proxy settings, if any.

One problem is that KLIMB's large-scale maps don't use the same
underlying coordinate system as the zoom maps, so places don't
always line up correctly between the two.

'''3-DIMENSION PROFILES'''

Here's a really sexy new feature. You can display your route or
track in a 3-dimensional view. You can then use your mouse to
rotate or scale the view.

This feature uses the program gnuplot. I've included a copy in the
Windows distribution. For other platforms, you can download a copy
from http://www.gnuplot.info/.

'''ANNOTATIONS'''

This feature lets you place labels or annotations on the map. You can
add them for a single road or node or for all of them on a route.

'''GPS SUPPORT'''

I got a new toy, a GPS receiver, and wanted to make KLIMB work
with it. Seeing your actual track on the map is really cool,
especially KLIMB's feature of highlighting all the hills
over a certain height and slope. KLIMB has GPS features for
both before a ride and after a ride:
   * save route as a GPX file that can be downloaded to the GPS receiver
   * upload GPS tracks
     - display tracks and waypoints
     - compute total climbing (filtering out small fluctuations)
     - show profile of the track
     - find and highlight hills over a given height and slope


'''MINOR CHANGES'''
   * Geocaches
     - Geocaches are another GPS oriented activity. KLIMB will load a \
geocache file and display all the caches. You can also bring up the web page \
associated with any geocache. See www.geocaching.com for details and the data \
file to load into KLIMB.
   * Region Info
     - Dialog displaying region size, highest and lowest node, longest road, \
etc.
   * About Klimb dialog picture enhanced -- try right clicking on it.
     - Try going to either the Stelvio or Gavia picture, view the large image \
and drool
   * Ridelog -- statistics and filtering
     - You can now say show me all rides after March 24, 2004 that were \
longer than 30 miles that went through node 120.
   * Scale in the legend
   * Fixed up some bad road data
   * Route description wording slightly changed
   * UTM maps: KLIMB understands maps in UTM format; no visible change for \
the user, but this allows:
     - zooming (see above)
     - creating new zones using terraserver maps--I have tools to automate this
   * Minor fix to profile graph ticks
   * Better mouse wheel handling
   * Automatically detect http proxy info
-------------------
title: What's New in Version 2.0
alias: Version 2.0

'''ZONES'''

Many people have asked me if it is possible to have KLIMB for other
areas, and then I moved to Ohio and wanted the same. So I added the
concept of zones which are a collection of KLIMB regions. You can
switch between zones at any time, and you can specify which zone to
start in either by the Customize dialog or by using the -z command
line switch. I've also created some zones for some of the East Bay
hiking trails.

'''INSTALLATION'''

For Windows users there is a separate setup program for installing
KLIMB. KLIMB will now appear on the start menu and, optionally, as a
desktop icon and quick launch icon.

'''POINTS OF INTEREST'''

Places of interest, like where to find water or a covered bridge, are
now marked on the map with a red star. I welcome people sending me addition
places to include.

'''SPLIT ROAD'''

This features lets you split an existing road at a given spot into two
roads. This greatly facilitates mapping your exact route. This
seemingly simple function is actually quite tricky, especially in how
it interacts with saving and loading routes.

'''ZOOM OUT'''

Any existing region can be shrunken to half its existing size. This is
useful when you want to get a better overview and don't care so much
about the details.

'''COORDINATE LOCATOR'''

This feature will locate the latitude and longitude position you enter.

'''PRINTING TO POSTSCRIPT'''

This is the start of the facility to print KLIMB routes. You select a
portion of the map and KLIMB will save that as postscript, which you
can then send to a printer using other tools. I know this isn't a
great solution--it's slow and creates a huge postscript file, but it's
a start. (A better solution still is to use a screen grabbing utility
like IrfanView.)

'''NODE NEIGHBORHOOD'''

By right clicking on a node you can bring up the Node Neighborhood
dialog. This dialog lets you do two things: first, find all nodes and
roads that are within a specified distance of the selected node, and
second, find the shortest route from that node to any other node.

Also, when this dialog is up, the balloon help for any node will display
the distance to the selected node.

'''PROFILE GRAPH'''

The profile graph now also displays accumulated feet climbed along the
route.

'''MISCELLANEOUS'''
   * Route turnings now allow for zigzag turns
   * Two new route description formats:
          1. space-delimited -- like tab-delimited but it copies better to \
text editor for printing
          1. minimal -- just the bare-bones details
   * Normal route description uses "about xx miles" when showing guessed data
   * Multiple roads between the same nodes
   * Unknown distances now better estimated via a technique using the great \
circle between the points
   * Many more bike quotes
   * Several new dialog images, especially for the About dialog
   * OptionMenu widget used for entries with fixed types, e.g. color selection
   * Smaller font for node label (they should fit nicely now)
   * Advanced selection for all magnification
   * Legend window showing all the colors for all the different roads
   * More road types: single track, fire break, paved fire road
   * Zones can have their own RC file

'''New in version 1.5'''
   * Zones: map data is broken up into zones to allow KLIMB to work with \
other areas
   * Points Of Interest: places where water, food or bathrooms are available \
and other interesting locations are marked with a star
   * Printing: the beginnings of the ability to print maps
   * Splits: an easy way to create a new node in an existing road
   * New help system
   * Multiple overview maps
-----
title: 3D Profile

3D Profile allows you to view your route as a 3-dimensional graph using the
external utility ''gnuplot''.
I've included a copy in the
Windows distribution. For other platforms, you can download a copy
from http://www.gnuplot.info/.

'''Did you know?'''
   * In ''gnuplot'', holding down and moving the mouse button \
lets you change the viewing angle.
   * Also, holding down and moving the middle mouse button \
lets you change the graph scale.
------
title: Google Maps

This feature lets you view your route in a Google map embedded
in a web page. A temporary web page is created on your machine
and then viewed in a browser. Client side web code
accesses Google's map web service to create the map and to
display your route.

------
title: Google Earth

The Google Earth feature lets you view your route in the free
program Google Earth. The route gets converted into Google Earth's
KML format. On Windows, you can elect to have the result run
directly.
------
title: Route Info

The Route Info dialog lets you view some statistics about your ride.
In addition to distance and total climbing, you can see the biggest climb
and descent, the highest and lowest points. You can also use this dialog
to automatically add [annotations] along the route.

 * To open Route Info, select ''Info'' off the Route menu.
------
title: Mileposts
alias: milepost

Mileposts button on the button bar toggles the display of markers
at mileposts along the route.

 * You can [configure] how far apart mileposts appear.

------
title: Trace Route
alias: tracing
alias: trace

Trace route shows an animation of your route being traced. At any point
in the animation, the current distance with total climbing and descending
is displayed. Also, the estimated time to reach that point is shown for
various average speeds.

'''Did you know?'''
 * The average speed fields are the same ones used by the [route description] \
(which you can [customize]).
 * Tracing animation is also done on the [profile] graph.
------
title: Profile Graph
alias: Profile

The Profile dialog shows the ups and downs of your route. It uses node
elavations, road waypoint elevations and known climbing numbers for each
road to produce the graph.

For roads with [USGS elevation] information, the profile graph will be
very accurate but for roads without this information, the data between
the nodes is interpolated.

''Accumulated Climbing'' shows you the climbing so far.

See also [Gradients].

'''Did you know?'''
 * Double clicking on a node on the profile graph will highlight the \
node in the main window.
 * Tooltip information appears when hovering the mouse on the profile graph.
 * [Hills] are highlighted on the profile graph.
 * When [tracing] a route, the trace also occurs on the profile graph.
 * You can configure the appearance of the graph.
 * You can exclude nodes from the graph by using [Route Turnings].
 * You can delete a label by right-clicking on it
----
title: Customize
alias: configure

The Customize dialog is found on the '''Tools''' menu. It lets you
control the appearance of numerous aspects of program, from the color
shown for various types of roads to the size of the nodes; from the font
used in the help system to the size of the 3d profile graph.

The values are stored in the file ''klimb.rc'' in the KLIMB directory.
Zones can have customization specific to that zone, and these values
are stored in the ''klimb.rc'' in that zone directory.

'''Did you know?'''
  * You can use customize to change show all values in meters and kilometers.
  * You can specify which zone and region KLIMB should start in.
----
title: Options
alias: Option

The Options dialog lets you control some more esoteric aspects of KLIMB,
some of which are only useful for people creating new zones. Two options,
however, are useful to the general user: 

 * ''Windows Association'' -- allows you to double-click on a KLIMB route \
file and have it automatically launch KLIMB. 
 * ''Zoom Cache'' -- displays the amount of disk space used by \
the [zoom] cache, and optionally lets you empty the cache.
----
title: Weather

The Weather dialog displays the weather forecast for the
current region for the next five days. It gets is data by querying the
NOAA website.
----
title: Node Neighborhood

What's the shortest route from my house to the the top of the local
big climb? Where can I get to from my house in just 10 miles?

These questions can be answered with the ''Node Neighborhood'' dialog
by right-clicking on a node and selecting the menu option.
----
title: Points of Interest
alias: POI

The red stars you see scattered on the map indicate some interesting location,
such as where water can be found or some historic event occurred. 

Hovering the mouse over the star will give you a short description and
double clicking on it will bring up all the details. Some entries have
web pages associated with them, and a button will appear letting you 
bring up that page.

'''Did you Know?'''
 * You can see a list of all POI locations on the ''Node List''.
----
title: Geocaches
alias: geocache

Geocaching is fun, new activity where people use a GPS device to
try and locate ''geocaches'' that others have hidden. Check out
''http://www.geocaching.com/'' for details.

The Geocache Dialog lets you view on the maps geocaches hidden in your
region (you must download this information first). A geocache is marked by a
magenta spoked circle. Double clicking on the symbol displays details
of that cache, and provides a button to go directly to the 
cache's webpage.

'''Did you Know?'''
 * You can see a list of all geocaches on the ''Node List''.
----
title: GPS Support

KLIMB supports a GPS device in two ways. First, you can upload
[GPS tracks] and see them displayed on the maps. Second, you
can save a route in [GPX] format which you can download to your
device.
----
title: GPX Export
alias: GPX

GPX Export is an XML based description of your current route. It is
one of the formats available in the [Route Description] dialog. You
can download it to your GPS device to provide directions for your next
ride.
----
title: GPS Tracks

GPS devices allow you to save and upload ''tracks'' of showing where
you've been. KLIMB can read those file, and it will then display the track on
the map, give you distance, climbing and other statistics and show you
all the [hills].

'''Did you know?'''
 * A sample GPS track file is provided with KLIMB to let you play \
with this feature.
----
title: Ride Log Statistics

When the [ride log] is displayed, the ''Ride Log Statistics'' dialog
displays some statistics for all the rides, such as total distance, 
average ride length, longest ride, fastest speed, etc.

If you have applied a [ride log filter], then the statistics are only
for those rides matching the filter.
----
title: Ride Log Filter

When the [ride log] is displayed, you can specify criteria for
a ride to match to be displayed. For example, you can restrict
only rides since a certain day, longer than a given distance,
going through a specific node, traversing a specific road, etc.

The ''Skip blank entries'' checkbox indicates whether a blank 
field is considered a match or not.
----
title: Annotations

Annotations are like yellow sticky-notes that you can add
to the map. You can add your own annotations anywhere by
right clicking on an empty part of the map and selecting
''Add Annotation''. Alternatively, you can right clicking on node, 
road, [POI], [geocache], etc. and add an annotation for that 
object with its details already filled out.

Clicking and dragging an annotation lets you move it to
exactly where you want it. With shout-outs, clicking
and dragging the annotation body keeps the anchor point
intact while clicking and dragging on the shout out moves
everything.

Double-clicking on an annotation lets you edit, delete
it or toggle the shout out arrow.

'''Did you know?'''
 * Both the [Route Info] and [Printing Maps] dialogs lets you \
annotate your route and control exactly what appears in the text.
 * You can click and drag on the shout out arrow to \
move the anchor point.
-----
title: Google

Right clicking on any object on the map and selecting
''Google Maps'' will bring up the Google Maps web page
for that location.

''Note'', for roads, Google maps may not show the same route
as KLIMB. If this happens, just try again--the second 
attempt will add an intermediary waypoint.

----
title: Bicycling Quotes

A list of bicycling quotes accumulated over the years is
available off the ''Help'' Menu.
----
title: Picture Gallery

The ''Picture Gallery'' presents thumbnails of a bunch of
cycling pictures. Double-clicking on any image will bring
up a larger version.

If you have a good cycling picture you'd like to share let
me know.

'''Did you know?'''
 * These pictures also appear on the ''About'' dialog.
 * Try right clicking on the image in the ''About'' dialog.

Kudos to anybody who can tell me what position Wim Van Est
was in when he went tumbling into the ravine on the Col d'Aubisque.
----
title: Zoom

You can zoom in on any road, node, [POI], [geocache] etc. at up
to 1 pixel = .25 meters. KLIMB automatically connects to the USGS
Terraserver website and downloads their maps for zooming. These
maps can be topographic, black and white aerial or color aerial
(the color maps presently cover about half the Bay Area but more
are being added daily).

The Zoom dialog lets you position nodes more precisely
and to [bend] roads to their true course. A new feature lets
you determine the [elevation] of a node or road route point.

You can move around the zoom display by:
 * using the scrollbars
 * using the mousewheel (shift for horizontal)
 * holding down the middle button and moving the mouse

The left-hand column has controls to let you select the 
type of map and level of zoom (not all levels are available
for a given map type).

'''Did you know?'''
 * maps downloaded from the USGS are cached in the ''zoom/'' directory.
 * the [Options] dialog shows the size of this cache and lets you clear it.

----
title: Bending Roads
alias: bend
alias: bent

The [Zoom] dialog is where you can ''bend'' a road so that it
follows its true course. You can only bend roads you've created
(unless you've chosen the ''superuser'' [option]).

You bend a road by adding ''route points'' through which the road
passes. Figuring out exactly where to locate route points is a 
balancing act.

'''To create a route point:'''
 * right click where you want it to go, and select ''Add New Route Point''
 * shortcut: ctrl-right click

'''To move a route point:'''
 * click and drag the route point

'''To delete a route point:'''
 * right click on it and select ''Delete this Route Point''

----
title: Adding Elevations
alias: USGS Elevation
alias: elevation
alias: usgs

The USGS recently added a web service that gives the
altitude of any point in the US (and parts of Canada
I'm told). 

The service is available within KLIMB largely through
the [Zoom] dialog. 

After position a new node exactly where you want it, click on the
"'''*'''" button and it will retrieve the elevation for that location.

For roads that you've [bent], you can add elevation information for
each route point either singly, by right clicking on the point, or
for every route point, by clicking on the "'''*'''" button.

With enough properly placed route points on a road, you can get a
fairly accurate elevation profile for a road.

'''CAVEAT''': roads which traverse the side of a mountain are notoriously
hard to get proper elevations for. A slight error in placing a
route point can yield big errors in elevation.

----
title: Coordinate Locator

The ''Coordinate Locator'' dialog lets you locate a specific 
point given its latitude and longitude position. You mark
that position on the map, on [Google] or [zoom] into it.

Also, while the ''Coordinate Locator'' dialog is up, as you
move the mouse over the map, the latitude and longitude of
the place the mouse is over is displayed in the status bar.

'''Did you know?'''
 * Holding down the shift-key and moving the mouse puts location back \
into the dialog.
 * If you have decimal latitude instead of degree, minutes, seconds just \
enter 0 for minutes and seconds.
----
title: Region Info

Every wanted to know the highest node in your region? or the longest
road? or just how big the region is? The ''Region Info'' dialog provides 
just that sort of information.

'''Did you know?'''
 * Clicking on the "'''*'''" button next to an entry will display \
and highlight the qualifying road or node.

----
title: Node List

The ''Node List'' displays a list of every node, [POI] and
[geocache]. You can double click on an item and it will be
highlighted.

'''Did you know?'''
 * Double clicking a ''Node List'' item will highlight it on the map.
 * Nodes in the current route are highlighted on the ''Node List''.

       1. save a route from the multiple regions
       1. klimb ''route file name''
----
title: Superuser

Turning on ''superuser'' mode in the [Options] dialog provides 
some extra rights to the user. These extra rights are mostly
for people creating their own zones.

One extra right is the
ability to [bend] and modify existing roads. Another is a 
special new menu with tools to show road and node data which
is missing or inconsistent.
----
title: Photos

The photos feature lets you link points on the map with
a given web page. 

To create a new photo marker, Right-click on the map where you want to 
place it and select ''Create Photo''. Fill in the form and press 
''Add Photo''. 

You can update or delete a photo by right-clicking on it, and selecting
''Update Photo''. Note, you cannot update or delete built-in photos 
unless you are [superuser].
----
title: Route Atlas
alias: Atlas

The route atlas features lets you create precise, detailed
maps of your bike route. You can closely control what part of the
map to grab and, by using this with the [zoom] feature, at exactly
what level of detail.

Instead of grabbing the whole map, which may force the scale to be
too small, you instead grab a set of smaller, more detailed maps.
These are then joined together to form an atlas. 

Clicking on the Atlas button causes a rectangular print selection
box to be displayed on either the main map window, or the [zoom] map
window if it is present.

You can '''move''' (by dragging the box), '''resize''' (by moving the
resize buttons), and '''rotate''' (by moving the resize box). In the
zoom window, you can also zoom in and out to get the desired level of
details. (NB. for rotation you need the xphoto extension which is only
available on Windows.)

Once you have the desired area selected, press the ''Take Snap Shot''
button. You can then add an optional caption for the map. Repeat the
process until you have all the maps you want. You can delete any maps
that don't work or re-order them. 

When you have all the maps you want, press the ''Save'' button to save
them as either as a web page or as a PDF file.

----
title: Arrows
alias: arrow

Arrows are markups you can place on your map showing
how to proceed at every intersections.

Arrows may be added in two ways. First, turning on the arrow option
will automatically add arrows at every node on your route. Second, 
you can right click where you want an arrow, select ''Create Arrow''
and bring up the Arrow Dialog. 

'''Did you know?'''
 * You can drag and move arrows.
 * Double clicking on an arrow lets you tweak the arrow shape.
 * Use [Route Turnings] and ''Omit from Route Description'' to remove an arrow \
at an intersection.
----
title: Gradients
alias: gradient

There are two ways to compute the actual gradient for a hill. The
first way is to use the [Hills Dialog], but that measures the entire
hill. So if a hill has a long, gentle lead up, that gets included in
the computation.

The second way is to open the [Profile Graph] for the road. Next, use
the mouse and click where you want to start the gradient calculation
then drag to the end. The selection will be highlighted and the gradient
will be calculated for it.
----
title: Favorites

The Favorites Dialog provides quick and easy access to a list of
your favorite rides. Clicking on any entry will load that route
into KLIMB.

 * To open favorites, click its button on the button bar.
 * To add a route to your favorites, use the [Route Info] dialog.

NB. only routes using default KLIMB nodes and roads can be
added to your favorites.
